# Boilerplate Neos distribution

The idea of this repo is to serve as a boilerplate for all [Neos](https://neos.io) projects that we(https://psmb.github.io) start.

**Don't use it directly, as it has a lot of code that is specific to our infrastructure! Rather clone and tune it for your own needs.**

## Workflow

1. Create a docker-compose.yml similar to the one listed below and run `docker-compose up -d`
2. Monitor `docker-compose logs web` until you see something like `INFO success: php-fpm entered RUNNING state`. Then go to the website url specified in docker-compose.yml and make sure it works.
3. Go to the location of the code (`data/www/releases/current`) and remove git files with `rm -rf .git`.
4. Edit all files as needed to start new project, create a new git repository and push it to Github when ready. Edit `docker-compose.yml` and `circle.yml` to point to new Github repo. Do the same on production/staging server when ready to go live.
